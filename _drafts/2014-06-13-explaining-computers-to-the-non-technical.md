title: Explaining Computers to the Non-Technical

Explaining the magic of modern computing to non-technical friends and family can
be a frustrating endeavor. We've all been there.

We've clarified to our Dad that his 2001 Gateway is a tad sluggish because
of its outdated hardware, __not__ the number of icons on its Desktop.

We've shown our friend's mom that her internet connection works just fine
without signing into AOL.

We've *INSERT OTHER ANECDOTE*.

I've struggled with de-mystifying the inner-workings of the devices
we depend on in most aspects of modern life.

Then, one year at Thanksgiving dinner I overheard my uncle explain computer
hardware using a simple and approachable metaphor.

# A Computer is a Library

Imagine you are sitting at an empty desk in a library. Pretend that you're a
voracious reader who can't stop reading. You and `your mind` are the `Central
Processing Unit (CPU)`. When you're reading, you're using your CPU's computing
power.

Each `book` containing `words` that you read is a `file` consisting of `bytes`.
As you read, you have at most 2 `pages` of your book open at any time. This is
your CPU's `cache`. It's quick and easy to jump to and read any word on those
two pages. If you wanted to read other words on other pages, you would need to
`thumb` through the pages, or in the case of your `cache`, `swap` in other
bytes.

If you want to read from another book, you'd have to get up and bring the `book`
to your `table`. If you're table is `really small`, you'd have to put your first
book back on the shelf. If you had a `larger table`, you would be able to have
many books on your `table` at once. You'd be able to read from all the books on
your table without making the long and arduous trip to the book shelves. A
`bigger table` would save you time and make reading from many `books` much
faster than a `smaller table`. This is the way that `Random Access Memory (RAM)`
works, keeping pertinent `files` and `bytes` easily accessible to your `CPU`.

To prevent your `table space` from becoming a crowded mess, you need to bring
the books that you're no longer reading back to the `shelves`. At first, you
`carry them by hand`. When you tire of making countless trips juggling `large
stacks of thick books`, you grab a`book cart`. The `cart` can carry way more
books than you can, and it has `wheels` that make pushing it a breeze!
The `book cart` shuttles books back and forth from the `book shelves` to the
`table` a lot like your CPU's `bus` sends files and bytes back and forth from
your `hard disk` to your `RAM`.

After a while, you read every `book` in the `library`. You convince the
librarian to order more `books`, but their `book cases` can't fit any more
books! The city has to `build an addition` so that they can fit more `book
cases` in the library. This is a lot like `installing a bigger hard disk`.
The newer `book cases` the city buys comes with the awesome `Dewey Decimal
System`, which tells you exactly where any particular book is on the `shelf`,
saving you the time it takes to search through an entire `shelf`. This system is
a lot like a `Solid State Drive (SSD)`. SSD's are much better at indexing where
a file lives than their `Hard Disk Drive (HDD)` counterparts.

## The Internet

* Other Libraries = Other Computers
* Book Exchange / Loaning = Internet
* Library Name = Hostname
* Library Phone Number = IP Address
* First make Phone Call for Availability, If available, send book = Ping, Get File
URL, Download File

## The Cloud (e.x. Dropbox)

You're a publisher

* You Write Your Book at the Library = Create file on your machine
* You send your book to a publisher to make more copies = sending to Dropbox
* Your publisher sends the book to other libraries = distributing across their
data centers / CDN
  * You go on vacation = you go somewhere with your phone
* You go to the local library = Different computer (phone)
  * That library has your book, so you don't have to go back to your usual library
  = your phone has the file, you don't have to go home to your desktop
